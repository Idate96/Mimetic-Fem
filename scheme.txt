Design option 0:
One function space class, multiple generators like def FunctionSpace_0_Form,
Function_Space_1_Form ... . But what about the numbering for the dof?
We can create a class for the numbering DofMap() that is called by the constructor of the function space
and will generate the right numbering scheme.
As for the basis fucntions we can generate three major classes to inherit from: Element_0-form,
element_1-form , elemnt -2 form. (or instead of element basis).
Possibly we can wrap the function spaces again
For the diffusion tensor just create a class that can be defined as attribute to the mesh.
